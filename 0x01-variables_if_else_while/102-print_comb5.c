/**
 * main - main block
 * Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
*The numbers should range from 0 to 99
*The two numbers should be separated by a space
*All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
*The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
*The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
*00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
*You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
*You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code
*You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
*All your code should be in the main function
*Return: 0
